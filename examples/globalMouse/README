Karamba Eyes 0.6 by Wilfried.Huss@gmx.at
----------------------------------------

Karamba Eyes is a implementation of the classic xeyes for superkaramba.


INSTALLATION:
	Karamba Eyes needs a small Python extension module named xcursor
	which is implemented in the file extension/xcursor.c.

	To build it go to the extension subdirectory and type

		python setup.py build
	
	(The Python develop package needs to be installed)

	This creates the shared library xcursor.so, probably in a subdirectory
	named build. This file needs to be copied in the same directory as the
	eyes.theme and eyes.py file.

	A precompiled xcursor.so file is included (Compiled on Mandrake 9.1).

CHANGES:
	* Moving the theme now works as it should.
	* Widget Mask added

TODO:
	Add Theme Support
